### Hi, I'm Brandon!
Iâ€™m a web developer currently working in the
							JavaScript ecosystem, particularly React, Express,
							and Node, along with the help of a MongoDB or
							PostgreSQL database here and there. I have a passion
							for creating apps anchored by solid visual design
							and code quality principles, no one likes junk! I
							constantly work to improve my process, integrate new
							trends, and explore technology with the goal of
							building stuff that makes the world just a bit
							better for others.

I love a good challenge and learning new things. My brain thrives on exploring the intersection of art and science, sarcastic humor, and pondering the complexities of the human condition. Also coffee, lots and lots of coffee! â˜• â˜• â˜•
